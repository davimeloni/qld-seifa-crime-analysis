üìä SEIFA & Crime Rate Analysis (Queensland)
This project investigates the relationship between socio-economic disadvantage (measured by SEIFA indexes) and crime rates (focusing on domestic violence and violent crimes) across Queensland local government areas. The goal is to identify how socio-economic conditions influence serious crime, using regression analysis and data visualization.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project was created as a learning exercise in data analysis and statistical modeling. While care has been taken in cleaning and analyzing the data, the results and interpretations are subject to the limitations of an individual learning process. Conclusions drawn should not be considered authoritative or used for policy-making without further validation.

üîç Project Overview
Focus: Domestic violence-related and violent crime rates

Exclusions: Property and drug-related crimes (to isolate socio-economic impact)

Data Sources:

SEIFA 2021 Indexes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)

Crime data from Queensland Government Open Data Portal

üß† Methodology
Grouped raw crime data into major categories

Normalized by population

Filtered out low-population areas

Performed log-transformation of crime rates

Fitted multiple linear regression using SEIFA indexes (IRSD, IER, IEO)

Evaluated model using R¬≤, residual diagnostics, and coefficient analysis

üìà Key Findings
IRSD (Disadvantage) is negatively correlated with DV and violent crimes

IER (Education & Employment) and IEO (Economic Opportunity) showed slight positive correlations with crime

All predictors were statistically significant (p < 0.001)

Regression models achieved R¬≤ values of 0.966 (DV) and 0.980 (Violent), indicating strong explanatory power

Note: While the SEIFA indexes were statistically significant predictors of crime rates, the overall relationships were moderate. The data points showed a general trend but were fairly spread out‚Äîsuggesting that while socio-economic disadvantage matters, other factors likely play a role too.
